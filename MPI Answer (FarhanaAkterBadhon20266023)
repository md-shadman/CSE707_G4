1 ans: Message Passing Interface

2 ans: 
MPI_Init(int *argc, char ***argv)
Takes the command line arguments to a program, checks for any MPI options, and passes remaining command line arguments to the main program.

MPI_Comm_size( MPI_Comm comm, int *size )
Determines the size of a given MPI Communicator. A communicator is a set of processes that work together. For typical programs this is the default MPI_COMM_WORLD, which is the communicator for all processes available to an MPI program.

MPI_Comm_rank( MPI_Comm comm, int *rank )
Determine the rank of the current process within a communicator. Typically, if a MPI program is being run on N processes, the communicator would be MPI_COMM_WORLD, and the rank would be an integer from 0 to N-1.

3 ans:
The current version of the MPI standard is 3.0
